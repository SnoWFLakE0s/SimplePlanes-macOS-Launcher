# SimplePlanes-macOS-Launcher
An more accessible launcher for the game SimplePlanes for Mac users, skipping the need for going into Steam and launch from there.

Notes: I made this using AppleScript. Literally a single line of rubbish, nothing too special. 

This will work even if you have the SimplePlanes dragged out of the original steamapps repository. It doesn't matter where it is, if you have the game, it will launch. 

**Why, you ask?**

I wanted to save the pain of going through Steam. Also, less apps open = more performance. Plus, you save your own energy by clicking on less things. Two birds with one stone!
